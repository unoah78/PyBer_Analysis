# PyBer Rider Share Data Analysis

## <ins>Overview</ins>

This project covers rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 to provide perspective of what areas our brand is currently strong, other areas where we may need to focus resources, as well where our best oppurtunities lie. 

## <ins>City, Drivers and Fares Totals</ins>

We started this project by analizing the total rides captured from each city type with the database created for *Rural*,*Suburban* and *Urban* cities for the five month period data collected.

PyBer had 2,375 total rides during this period with:

- **Rural** cities accounting for 125 rides.
- **Suburban** cities accounting for 625 rides.
- **Urban** cities accounting for 1,625 rides.

PyBer current strength is in the **Urban** market with having the most drivers to accomodate the number of rides booked. 

The **Suburban** market is steady with room to grow both in rides booked and drivers. An increase in advertisements and communication on the beenfits for driving for PyBer could produce some growth.

**Rural** city ridership needs target campaigning as first and last mile oppurtunities are few and far between. Possibly adding the benefits of using PyBer instead of driving to an airport and having to pay for parking. Once ridership shows signs of increase there may need to be a campaign to enroll more drivers to accomdate the increase of bookings.
